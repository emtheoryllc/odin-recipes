# odin-recipes

The purpose of this project is to flex my learning muscles. This will be the first project I have created utilizing HTML coding to create a website.

The task of this project is to create a website of 3 recipes along with a "Home Page". The Home Page will linke to the respective recipes.

Each recipe will have several elements coded onto the page to demonstrate my skills ranging from inserting pictures to lists and basic text formatting.

Adding some text to make sure I have the Git Comment feature tested.
