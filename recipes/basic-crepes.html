        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flower</li>
                <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
                <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            </ul>              

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a large mixing bowl, whisk together
                    the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in
                    the milk and water, stirring to combine.
                    Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over
                    medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto
                    the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each
                    crepe. Titl the pan with a circular motion so that
                    the batter coats the surface evenly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom
                    is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook
                    the other side. Serve hot.
